Q3. Write a brief intro on available data types in Javascript.
Ans. In programming, data types is an important concept. To be able to operate on variables, it is important to know something about the type. Without data types, a computer cannot safely solve this:
	var x = 16 + "Volvo";
JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types:
Example
	var x;           // Now x is undefined
	x = 5;           // Now x is a Number
	x = "John";      // Now x is a String
Data types in Javascript are-
1. JavaScript Strings: A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like "Harshal Parate". Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes:
Example
	var carName1 = "Lenovo ideapad 330";   // Using double quotes
	var carName2 = 'Lenovo ideapad 330';   // Using single quotes

2. JavaScript Numbers: JavaScript has only one type of numbers. Numbers can be written with, or without decimals:
Example
	var x1 = 34.00;     // Written with decimals
	var x2 = 34;        // Written without decimals

3. JavaScript Booleans: Booleans can only have two values: true or false. Booleans are often used in conditional testing.
Example
	var x = 5;
	var y = 5;
	var z = 6;
	(x == y)       // Returns true
	(x == z)       // Returns false

4. JavaScript Arrays: JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets. Array items are separated by commas. Array indexes are zero-based, which means the first item is [0], second is [1], and so on. The following code declares (creates) an array called cars, containing three items (car names):
Example
	var cars = ["HP", "Dell", "Asus"];

5. JavaScript Objects: JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}. Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.
Example
	var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};

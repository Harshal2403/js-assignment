Q2. Write the difference between var, let and const with code examples.
Ans. The difference is as follows-
1. var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped, 
	var greeter = "hey hi";    
    	function newFunction() {
        	var hello = "hello";
    	}

while let and const are block scoped.
	let greeting = "say Hi";
   	let times = 4;
	   if (times > 3) {
	        let hello = "say Hello instead";
 	       console.log(hello);// "say Hello instead"
    	}
   console.log(hello) // hello is not defined

2. var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; 
    	var greeter = "hey hi";
    	var greeter = "say Hello instead";
    	 greeter = "say Hello instead";

let variables can be updated but not re-declared; 
    	let greeting = "say Hi";
    	greeting = "say Hello instead";
this will return an error:
   	 let greeting = "say Hi";
   	 let greeting = "say Hello instead"; // error: Identifier 'greeting' has already been declared

const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.
    	const greeting = "say Hi";
    	greeting = "say Hello instead";// error: Assignment to constant variable. 
nor this:
    	const greeting = "say Hi";
    	const greeting = "say Hello instead";// error: Identifier 'greeting' has already been declared

3. They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var variables are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized.
    	console.log (greeter);
    	var greeter = "say hello"
it is interpreted as this:
    	var greeter;
    	console.log(greeter); // greeter is undefined
    	greeter = "say hello"

4. While var and let can be declared without being initialized, 
     	var greeter;
     	let greeter;
const must be initialized during declaration.
     	const greeter; //throws error
      	const greeter = "hey hi";
